# Stats for Spotify 

A web application that lets you view your Spotify listening activity! The goal is to have a functional self-sustaining web app that shows user data of their top tracks, artists, and albums with time ranges for each in a pretty website. I will also explore playlist creation based off the user's listening activity and concert tracking based off their top artists. Capstone project for Mr. Park's ICS4U class.

## Languages/Frameworks
Web application was created through Flask. Spotipy was used to access the Spotify Web API through Python. HTML and CSS were used for the website.
