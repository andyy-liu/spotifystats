# Stats for Spotify 

A web application that lets you view your Spotify listening activity! The goal is to have a functional self-sustaining web app that shows user data of their top tracks, artists, and albums with time ranges for each in a pretty website. I will also explore playlist creation based off the user's listening activity and concert tracking based off their top artists. Capstone project for Mr. Park's ICS4U class.

## Technology Used
Web application was created through Flask. Spotipy was used to access the Spotify Web API through Python. HTML and CSS were used for the website. ChatGPT was used to troubleshoot problems and improve understanding.
